Import wrapper for MySQLdb.

MySQLdb is an independent package, not part of Python, and has some
minor version skew issues with respect to Python itself, which we want
to suppress so that they don't annoy the user.  None of this is
particularly hard, but the maze of whacky incantations required to do
this in multiple version of Python on multiple platforms is somewhat
tedious, and turns out to cause other problems when combined with the
way we construct executable Python scripts containing a standard
header indicating the location of our config file.

So it turns out to be easier just to put all of the import voodoo
here, and have other modules that need MySQLdb import the MySQL module
object from this module.  Looks kind of strange, but seems to work.
