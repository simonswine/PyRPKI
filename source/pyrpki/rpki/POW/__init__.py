## Python OpenSSL Wrappers (POW) is an old (but well-written)
## interface between Python and OpenSSL (ok, you could have guessed
## that from the name).  Sadly, it appears to have fallen by the
## wayside, and M2Crypto is getting a lot more attention these days.
##
## POW ships with a submodule, POW.pkix, which includes a wonderful
## set of pure-Python routines for dealing with ASN.1 encodings of
## X.509v3 certificates, extensions, and related data.  I haven't
## found anything as good anywhere else.  This code deserves to be
## salvaged and put to work.
