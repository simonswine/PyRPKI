"""
Classes to represent IP addresses.

Given some of the other operations we need to perform on them, it's
most convenient to represent IP addresses as Python "long" values.
The classes in this module just wrap suitable read/write syntax around
the underlying "long" type.

These classes also supply a "bits" attribute for use by other code
built on these classes; for the most part, IPv6 addresses really are
just IPv4 addresses with more bits, so we supply the number of bits
once, here, thus avoiding a lot of duplicate code elsewhere.
